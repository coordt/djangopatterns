=====================
Abstract Model Mixins
=====================

.. warning::
   This is just a stub document. It will be fleshed out more. Please don't comment on it.


GLAMKit (Gallery, Library, Archive, Museum) an Australian group, tackles this situation with a set of abstract classes that provide very basic features. 

You create your model by subclassing the classes that provide the functionality you need.

And you donâ€™t have to stop there. You can add your own fields as well.


.. code-block:: python

	class PRBlog(EntryBase, 
	             StatusableEntryMixin):
	    
	    subhead = models.CharField()
	    pdf = models.FileField()
